# About

This repository contains the source code for our final exam in the course Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning, at IT University of Copenhagen. We analyse the resilience against typographical errors between models for Named Entity Recognition task in NLP. The comparison is between BERT and BiLSTM, with both word and character-level embeddings. By injecting different types of noise in the test dataset, at different levels, we want to compare the drop in performance among NLP models to define how robust they are against typos.
